# Changelog

All notable changes to RepoLens will be documented in this file.

## 0.3.0

### 💥 Breaking Changes
- **Removed Mermaid diagram system**: Replaced complex SVG/mermaid.ink pipeline with simple Unicode architecture diagrams
- System map now renders as beautiful ASCII art using box-drawing characters
- No longer requires 50MB @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli dependency
- No longer generates or commits SVG files to repository
- Diagrams now always work reliably in Notion and Markdown without external dependencies

### ✨ Improvements
- **Unicode Architecture Diagrams**: Clean, always-working diagrams with emoji icons (🎯, ⚙️, 📋, 🔌, 🛠️, ✅, 📦)
- **Simpler workflow**: Removed Mermaid CLI installation and SVG commit steps from GitHub Actions
- **Faster publishing**: No SVG generation or git operations needed
- **Better reliability**: No URL length limits, no image loading issues, no external service dependencies
- **Interactive credential collection**: `repolens init` now prompts for Notion credentials and auto-creates .env file

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Simplified `renderSystemMap()` to return plain markdown strings with embedded Unicode diagrams
- Removed `generateMermaidImageUrl()`, `prepareDiagramUrl()`, and mermaid.ink fallback logic
- Simplified `replacePageContent()` in notion.js - no longer handles image embedding
- Simplified markdown publisher - no longer generates SVG files
- Cleaned up GitHub Actions workflow - removed write permissions and diagram commits
